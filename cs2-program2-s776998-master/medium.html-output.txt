You 
should 
learn 
some 
things 
about 
queues 
when 
you 
write 
this

You

queues 
are 
FIFO 
data 
structures
 
adding

a 
queue 
is 
called 
"enqueue" 

 
enqueues 
always 
happen 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
queue 

 
removing 
an 
item 
from 
a 
queue 
is 
called 
"dequeue" 

 
dequeues 
always 
happen 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
queue 

 
like 
stacks, 
you 
can't 
add 
to 
a 
full 
queue
