Enter a valid in-fix expression one token at a time with a space between each token (e.g. 5 4 + 3 2 1 - + *)
Each token must be an integer or an operator (+,-,*,)
1 + 2 + 3
1 2 3 + +

That expression equals 6
Evaluate another expression [Y/N]? y

Enter a valid in-fix expression one token at a time with a space between each token (e.g. 5 4 + 3 2 1 - + *)
Each token must be an integer or an operator (+,-,*,)
1 + ( 2 * 3 ) + 4
1 2 3 * 4 + +

That expression equals 11
